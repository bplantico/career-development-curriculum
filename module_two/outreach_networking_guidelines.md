# Outreach & Networking Plan
As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking, so it's necessary to make a plan for what you'll try to further your networking. 

Identify a contact you will reach out to by the end of this module. This could be a mentor, alum, or anyone from your current network. Describe:

Contact: Keif Hunniford

1. Why you want to connect with this person and what you want to talk about: I've worked with this person previously, but I was in a non-technical role and they were the CTO. They've hired and worked with Turing grads in the past, and I respect thei rexperience within the industry and insights that they can provide to someone who's changing careers.

2. When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet: I plan to contact them over the weekend with a text message and will set up meeting with them over our two week intermission.

3. What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them: I'll continue to connect with them and perhaps set up a once a quarter schedule.

4. What other steps will you take to start building a stronger network in the tech community? Be more active in the contacts that I already have, many of which are Turing alumni.
